# demo-writer
C++-based demo writer for BYOND.

## What does this do?

This records everything that happens in a game to a file. This includes objects, animations, etc. This file can be played back using the [demo viewer](github.com/yogstation13/demo-viewer).

This is built off of a stripped-down version of byond-extools, and is designed to be able to be run alongside either extools or auxtools without conflicting with them.
